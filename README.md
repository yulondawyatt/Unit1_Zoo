# Zoo

![](/example.png)

The Fullstack Zoo just hired some zookeeper interns who will be helping out for the next few months. They've contracted your team to build a web page that will help the new interns identify each animal and understand their needs and behaviors.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new repository using this one as a template.
2. Clone your new repository into a `block04` folder in your `coursework` folder.
3. Open the cloned folder with VS Code.

## Instructions

Here are the types of animals at the zoo, along with their names:

- Bears
  - Ollie
  - Mona
- Giraffes
  - Frankie
  - Coconut
- Lions
  - Mella
  - Karl
- Monkeys
  - Cookie
  - Earl
  - Banana Pudding
- Alligators
  - Wren
  - Aspen
  - Mika

1. Create an `index.html` file.
2. Set the `doctype` to `html`.
3. Set the `<html>` language to `en`.
4. Add a `<head>` and a `<body>`.
5. In the `<head>`, set the `<title>` of the web page to `Fullstack Zoo`.
6. Add a `<main>` element to the `<body>`.
7. Add an `<h1>` to the main with the text `Welcome to Fullstack Zoo`.
8. Underneath the `<h1>`, add a `<section>` element for each type of animal. Each section should contain:
   1. a corresponding heading
   2. an unordered list of the animal names
   3. an image with alt text
   4. a link to an external fact page where a zookeeper can find more information

> [!NOTE]
>
> You can use fake links and images! We are checking your ability to write HTML, not your ability to find animal facts.

## Submission

Submit the link to your public GitHub repository.
